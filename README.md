### Introduction

Fluid Tools has been my pet Java project, on and off, for the past 10 years. It grew out of a need to capture and refine key innovations in dependency injection and other areas, and to see how far one can go following certain coding principles.

Fluid Tools is thus a repository of various innovative answers I came up with to the recurring challenges at various projects over the years, and had the chance to fully work out at the pace only a pet project can afford.

Most, if not all, of these ideas have been inspired by the work of others – some much more knowledgable than I ever was –, and my contribution may simply be in taking key ideas to their logical conclusion, or thereabouts. Regardless of their origin, though, working on these ideas has been an immensely rewarding journey.

Fluid Tools is now at a point where the only major simplification I could see would come from dropping support for Java 6 and 7 and taking advantage of new support classes and interfaces that came with Java 8 – or even Java 9 if I wait another year or two and so risk even more of the auxiliary code becoming obsolete.

I believe there are important ideas embodied in Fluid Tools that could improve how we build Java systems. In addition to implementing them, I tried my best to describe and document those ideas but none of that matters if the work is not widely available for other to inspect and build upon.

So take a look, use what you find useful, criticize or improve what you don't, and in so doing make the world a better place.

### What is Fluid Tools?

Fluid Tools is a compact framework for software craftsmen aimed at making software composition a reality, where relatively independent, simple components are organized into a system of any complexity.

In practical terms, Fluid Tools is a set of Java libraries that help you write _less code_, and it does so not by adding but by _removing_ barriers, thus giving you more freedom to design your code. The tool itself tends _not_ to get in your way, hence the term _fluid_.

We strive for and encourage the highest level of clarity, minimalism, and object-oriented design with a hint of functional programming, where applications are composed of small, stateless, collaborating objects with [clearly defined responsibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), no [dependence on detail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle), no feature bloat, and no bad surprises.

Unlike other tools out there with similar functionality, our dependency injection containers require no [XML configuration](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-factory-metadata), no [manual](http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry-ioc-modules.html#TapestryIoCModules-AutobuildingServices) [bindings](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Bindings) and no [explicit manifest entries](http://tapestry.apache.org/autoloading-modules.html) to keep in sync with the code, no [run-time scanning](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.0.0.RC2/spring-framework-reference/html/ch03s10.html?ref=driverlayer.com/web) or [programmatic registration](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-java-instantiating-container-register) to find components, no decision to make about which [dependency injection style](http://picocontainer.com/injection.html) to adopt, and hardly any thought wasted on designing [hierarchies of containers](http://liferepo.blogspot.hu/2014/03/scoping-dependency-injection.html).

Change your design and architecture freely as your concepts, ideas, and requirements evolve: Fluid Tools will keep up with you.

### Getting the Code ###
The sources for these libraries can be downloaded using [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) like so:

```
$ git clone https://github.cob/aqueance/fluid-tools.git fluid-tools
```

**NOTE**: This is work in progress hence no release versions or downloads are available yet and some APIs may still change.

### Building Fluid Tools ###
Use [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) to build Fluid Tools:

```
$ cd fluid-tools
$ mvn install
```

**NOTE**: You need Maven 3.1+ to build, or use, these libraries.

#### Generating the Javadocs ####
The uncompressed Java documentation of Fluid Tools is generated by the following command:

```
$ mvn javadoc:aggregate
```

Once that command completes, the documentation starting page will be `target/site/apidocs/index.html`.

### Documentation ###
A short [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/aqueance/fluid-tools/wiki/Getting-Started) is provided to get you started with Fluid Tools, while the [User Guide](https://github.com/aqueance/fluid-tools/wiki/User-Guide---Introduction) covers the full spectrum of what you can do with Fluid Tools.

    <TITLE>Fluid Tools Package Overview</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<p>
    Managed component model for OSGi services, and components depending thereon.
</p>
<p>
    Fluid Tools improves the basic service management in OSGi with dependency injected component management based on the OSGi bundle and service life cycle.
</p>
<p>
    To take advantage of these improvements, implement your bundle as a collection of {@link org.fluidity.deployment.osgi.BundleComponentContainer.Managed},
    {@link org.fluidity.deployment.osgi.BundleComponentContainer.Registration} and {@link
    org.fluidity.deployment.osgi.BundleComponentContainer.Registration.Listener} components.
</p>
<p>
    Bundle life cycle observers are also recognized as {@link org.fluidity.composition.ComponentGroup @ComponentGroup} annotated {@link
    org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator} components.
</p>
<p>
    Managed component status can be queried using the {@link org.fluidity.deployment.osgi.BundleComponentContainer.Status} OSGi service that
    each bundle running a {@link org.fluidity.deployment.osgi.BundleComponentContainer} exports.

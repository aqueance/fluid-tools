<BODY>
<p>
    Managed component model for OSGi services and components depending thereon.
</p>
<p>
    Fluid Tools improves the basic service management in OSGi with dependency injected component management based on OSGi bundle and service life cycle.
</p>
<p>
    To take advantage of these improvements, implement your bundle as a collection of {@link org.fluidity.deployment.osgi.BundleComponentContainer.Managed},
    {@link org.fluidity.deployment.osgi.BundleComponentContainer.Registration} and {@link
    org.fluidity.deployment.osgi.BundleComponentContainer.Registration.Listener} components.
</p>
<p>
    Bundle and service dependent component life cycle observer are also recognized as {@link org.fluidity.deployment.osgi.BundleComponentContainer.Observer}
    components and {@link org.fluidity.composition.ComponentGroup @ComponentGroup} annotated {@link org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator} components.

<BODY>
<p>
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fluid-tools/">Fluid Tools</a> is a software composition framework. As a framework, it provides a <em>frame</em> to your
    application and once you have that frame set up, it becomes virtually invisible, thus allowing you to focus on your code rather than its frame.
</p>

<p>
    Fluid Tools also gives you basic and more advanced utilities that Fluid Tools itself makes extensive use of, internally.
</p>

<p>
    Fluid Tools does <em>not</em> conform to <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330">JSR 330: Dependency Injection for Java</a> and we don't consider
    that to be a deficiency in Fluid Tools.
</p>

<p>
    To get started with Fluid Tools, see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fluid-tools/wiki/GettingStarted">Getting Started</a> guide.
    For a complete documentation, see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fluid-tools/wiki/UserGuide">User Guide</a>.

    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fluid-tools/">Fluid Tools</a> is a software composition framework. As a framework, it provides a <em>frame</em> to your
    applications and once you have that frame set up, it becomes virtually invisible, thus allowing you to focus on your code rather than its frame.

    To get started with Fluid Tools, see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fluid-tools/wiki/GettingStarted">Getting Started</a> guide.

<p>
    Service provider interfaces to be used / implemented by the dependency injection container implementation.
</p>

<p>
    The entry point to the container implementation is a class implementing the {@link org.fluidity.composition.spi.ContainerProvider} interface that the
    implementation must provide. As long as the implementation is built using Maven and the <code>org.fluidity.maven:maven-composition-plugin</code> Maven
    plugin is used to build the implementation, no action is necessary for Fluid Tools to find the <code>ContainerProvider</code> other than packaging it in a
    JAR file and making sure that JAR file is loaded by the host application.
</p>

<p>
    The {@link org.fluidity.composition.spi.OpenComponentContainer} returned by the <code>ContainerProvider</code> should extend {@link
    org.fluidity.composition.spi.EmptyComponentContainer}.
</p>

<p>
    The implementation is offered a few basic services in the form of a {@link org.fluidity.composition.spi.ContainerServices} object given to the
    <code>ContainerProvider</code> whenever it is invoked.
